# Project 5 - *Tumblr Feed*

Submitted by: **Antwon Walls**

**Tumblr Feed** is an app that fetches a feed of real blog posts from the Tumblr API and displays them in a native iOS table view, which displays rows of vertically scrolling content in a single column (like call log, contacts, mail, settings, etc.)

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App has a configured table view and table view call
- [x] App populates the table view with data fetched from an API


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App fetches posts from a different Tumblr blog
- [x] App has a refresh control to update the table view

## Notes

The biggest challenge I had building this app is the look of the view controller. I had a lot of trouble with constraints and making my app look nice and neat (the width/height of the image, wrapping the text with an unlimited amount of words, making the bounds of each table view the same, etc.)
